This folder contains a Java project implementing a Stock price predictor specifically for GOLD Future commodity. This project uses Encog library.

TODO

# XOR

This folder contains a Java project implementing a XOR operation using encog library. 

The project contains following two solutions:

## Using Support Vector Machine as suppervised learning method.

## Using a basic Neural Network with following structure:

  - input layer with 2 Nodes.
  - one hidden layer with 3 nodes.
  - output layer with 1 node.
