# XOR

This folder contains a Java project implementing a XOR operation using encog library. 

The project contains following two solutions:

## Using Support Vector Machine as suppervised learning method.

## Using a basic Neural Network with following structure:

  .- input layer with 2 Nodes.
  .- one hidden layer with 3 nodes.
  .- output layer with 1 node.
